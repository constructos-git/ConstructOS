# ✅ GitHub Setup Complete!

## 🎉 Success!

Your ConstructOS repository is now fully set up and synced with GitHub!

### What's Been Configured

✅ **Git Repository**: Initialized and configured  
✅ **GitHub Remote**: Connected to `https://github.com/constructos-git/ConstructOS`  
✅ **Authentication**: Token stored securely in macOS keychain  
✅ **Auto-Push Hook**: Every commit automatically pushes to GitHub  
✅ **Code Pushed**: All your code is now on GitHub!

### View Your Repository

👉 **https://github.com/constructos-git/ConstructOS**

### How It Works Now

1. **Make changes** to your code
2. **Commit** with: `git commit -m "your message"`
3. **Auto-push**: The hook automatically pushes to GitHub!

You can also use:
- `pnpm run git:commit` - Auto-commit script
- `pnpm run git:status` - Check status
- `pnpm run git:push` - Manual push (usually not needed)

### iOS/Mobile Access

Since Cursor doesn't have an iOS app, use these options:

1. **GitHub Codespaces** (Recommended)
   - Full VS Code in browser
   - Visit: https://github.com/constructos-git/ConstructOS → Code → Codespaces

2. **GitHub Mobile App**
   - View/edit files, make commits
   - Download from App Store

3. **GitHub.dev**
   - Lightweight editor
   - Visit: https://github.dev/constructos-git/ConstructOS

4. **Working Copy** (iOS Git client)
   - Full Git functionality
   - Download from App Store

### Security Notes

- Your token is stored securely in macOS keychain
- The old token has been removed from commit history
- Auto-push will work for all future commits
- No need to enter credentials again

### Next Steps

You're all set! Just code, commit, and your changes will automatically sync to GitHub. 🚀
