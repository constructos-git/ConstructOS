# Cursor iOS App Setup for ConstructOS

## ✅ Repository Ready for Cursor iOS

Your ConstructOS repository is now set up and ready to use with the Cursor iOS app!

### Repository Details

- **GitHub URL**: https://github.com/constructos-git/ConstructOS
- **Default Branch**: `main`
- **Status**: Fully synced and ready

### Connecting from Cursor iOS

1. **Open Cursor iOS app** on your iPhone
2. **Connect to GitHub**:
   - The app should allow you to connect to your GitHub account
   - Or clone the repository directly using the URL
3. **Clone/Open Repository**:
   - Use the repository URL: `https://github.com/constructos-git/ConstructOS`
   - Or search for `constructos-git/ConstructOS` in the app

### Authentication

Since you're already logged into Cursor on your phone, the app should handle authentication automatically. If you need to authenticate:

- The repository uses HTTPS
- Your GitHub token is stored on your Mac's keychain
- Cursor iOS should use its own authentication (GitHub OAuth or token)

### Workflow from iOS

Once connected, you can:
- ✅ View and edit code
- ✅ Make commits
- ✅ Push changes (if authenticated)
- ✅ Pull latest changes
- ✅ Work on your code from anywhere!

### Syncing Between Devices

- **From Mac**: Commit and push → Auto-pushes to GitHub
- **From iOS**: Commit and push → Updates GitHub
- **Pull on either device**: Get latest changes

### Tips for iOS Development

1. **Pull before starting work**: `git pull origin main`
2. **Commit frequently**: Smaller commits work better on mobile
3. **Push when done**: Keep both devices in sync
4. **Use GitHub as source of truth**: Always pull before making changes

### Need Help?

If you encounter any issues connecting from Cursor iOS:
- Check that you're logged into the correct GitHub account
- Verify the repository URL is correct
- Make sure you have read/write access to the repository

Enjoy coding on the go! 🚀
